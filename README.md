# Recieve and Download MMS Messages. Powered by Twilio - Node.js/Express

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/receive-mms-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/receive-mms-node)

Use Twilio to receive and download MMS messages. For a step-by-step tutorial see the [Twilio docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/guides/receive-and-download-images-incoming-mms-messages-node).

## Note: protect your webhooks

Twilio supports HTTP Basic and Digest Authentication. Authentication allows you to password protect your TwiML URLs on your web server so that only you and Twilio can access them.

Learn more about HTTP authentication [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/security#http-authentication), and check out [our full guide to securing your Express application by validating incoming Twilio requests](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-secure-your-express-app-by-validating-incoming-twilio-requests).

## Local development

First you need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

To run the app locally:

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:TwilioDevEd/receive-mms-node.git && \

   cd receive-mms-node
   ```

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install -g yarn && \
    yarn install
    ```

1. Copy the sample configuration file and edit it to match your configuration

   ```bash
   $ cp .env .env.local
   ```
   You can find your `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` in your
   [Twilio Account Settings](https://www.twilio.com/console).
   You will also need a `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`, which you may find [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming).

   Run `source .env.local` to export the environment variables

1. Run the application

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
    Alternatively you might also consider using [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) for this. It works just like
    the node command but automatically restarts your application when you change any source code files.

    ```bash
    yarn global add nodemon && \
    nodemon index.js 
    ```

1. Check it out at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it

## Run the tests

You can run the tests locally by typing

```bash
yarn test
```
